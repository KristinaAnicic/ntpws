            <p>Early RPGs were simple text-based adventures that allowed players to explore worlds through the power of their 
            imagination. Titles like Zork and Colossal Cave Adventure offered minimal graphics but stood out for their rich 
            stories and challenging puzzles, giving players a strong sense of immersion.</p>
            
            <p>Over time, RPGs evolved into graphically sophisticated games like Ultima and Wizardry, introducing 2D graphics 
            and more complex combat systems. During the \'80s and \'90s, console RPGs like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger 
            won players’ hearts worldwide, further raising expectations within the RPG genre.</p>
            
            <p>The introduction of 3D graphics and open worlds in titles like The Elder Scrolls and Baldur’s Gate allowed 
            players freer exploration and nonlinear storytelling, along with more character customization options. RPGs became 
            deeper and more varied, allowing players to shape their adventures.</p>
            
            <p>MMORPGs like World of Warcraft opened doors for shared adventures and team missions with millions of players 
            globally, bringing a new social aspect to RPGs and widening possibilities for cooperative exploration.</p>

            <p>Today, advancements in virtual reality and artificial intelligence bring new possibilities to the RPG genre. 
            Games now use technology to offer personalized stories and ever-evolving worlds. The future of RPGs promises even 
            deeper storytelling and more innovative ways to craft personal adventures.</p>

            <p>Ray tracing brings a new level of realism to games by simulating natural light, shadows, and reflections in a 
            way that was previously possible only in movies. Games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Control use this technology to 
            create stunning worlds, setting new expectations for visuals in gaming.</p>
            
            <p>Ray tracing allows for incredible visual depth, especially in scenes with reflective surfaces or complex light 
            sources. With faster GPUs and better development tools, ray tracing is now accessible even in mainstream titles.</p>

            <p>Besides ray tracing, new technologies like DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) enable games to maintain 
            high resolution and performance using artificial intelligence. DLSS allows for smoother graphics with fewer 
            resources, making it a crucial tool for game development.</p>

            <p>Virtual reality (VR) introduces new possibilities in graphics. With VR technology, players can step into 
            fully realistic 3D worlds, which requires impressive graphics that can keep up with all player movements 
            and reactions in real-time.</p>

            <p>The future of graphics technology in gaming promises stunning visuals that will create a deeper gaming 
            experience. As hardware continues to improve, games are expected to look increasingly realistic, 
            allowing players to immerse themselves in worlds that feel almost lifelike.</p>
